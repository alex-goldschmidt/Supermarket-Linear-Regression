# Overview

For this project, I used the "Supermarket sales" dataset on Kaggle (cited in the Jupyter notebook I used for the project). Essentially, the main purpose of this project was to determine the relationship between two variables: "Gross income" and "Unit price". "Gross income" referred to the income supermarkets made from customer spending, while "Unit price" represented the price of groceries in U.S dollars. In the project, I decided to conduct a linear regression in order to best analyze the relationship between these variables. I don't want to spoil the results of my analysis on the data, but I'll leave a link below to show the project in its entirety.
